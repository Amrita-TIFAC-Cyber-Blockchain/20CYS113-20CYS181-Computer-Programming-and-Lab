### :books: Course Outcome

| CO#  | CO Description |
|------|----------------|
| CO1 | Understand the typical programming constructs: data (primitive and compound), control, modularity, recursion etc. thereby to understand a given program |
| CO2 | Understand and analyze a given program by tracing, identifying coding errors and debugging them. |
| CO3 | Make use of the programming constructs appropriately and effectively while developing computer programs. |
| CO4 | Develop computer programs that implement suitable algorithms for problem scenarios and applications |
